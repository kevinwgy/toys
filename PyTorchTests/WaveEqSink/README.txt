The results.txt file was generated by solving a 1D wave equation with a 'model' sink term.
The matlab code for the simulation can be found in: /projects/wang_aoe_lab/ShafquatIslam/matlab_codes

Use a neural network to 'predict' the outputs within the sample space.

The first 800 data points (rows) were used as the training data, whereas the last 200 points were used for validation

Step 1: Open nn.py, specify the model and training parameters in the "USER'S INPUT" section
  ==> For polynomial fitting, the order/degree of polynomial can be specified
  ==> For neural networks, the layers of the network can be specified in "class NeuralNetwork"

Step 2: Training the model
  $python nn.py
  ==> Neural network will be saved in "model_scripted.pt".
  ==> Will generate a few plots

Step 3: Plot results
  $python plot_results.py
  ==> Edit "plot_results.py" to specify the plots needed.
