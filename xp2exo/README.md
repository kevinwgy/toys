# Overview
XPost is a tool created by Alex Main for converting ASCII data files generated by Aero-F and Aero-S into the .exo (Exodus II) format, which can be easily visualized.

# Compilation instructions
1. Compile Exodus II
  - decompress `exodus-6.09.tar.gz` (or download your own version of Exodus II)
  - enter `exodus-6.09/exodus`, compile it by running
```
    cmake .
    make -j4
```
    Exodus depends on HDF5 and NetCDF. You may need to tell cmake where to find them.

2. Compile XPost: in the main repository, run
```
    cmake .
    make
```
